# DRAFT IN PROGRESS AI Ethics Book club in a Box

This is DataKind UK&#39;s intro to setting up a data ethics book club. We started in 2019, with book club events run every 6-8 weeks or so in London, Edinburgh and remotely, and there has been interest from others who would like to replicate (and, we hope, improve!).

 &quot;Book club&quot; is perhaps a misnomer. We used books as well as journal articles, blogs, news stories, videos of talks and even poems.

The aims of the book club were to (1) foster discussions of ethics issues among our data science community, and later on, the wider data science community, that they can take back to their day jobs/careers, (2) to educate and inform our community on ethical issues, to better enable them to support social change organisations; and (3) to strengthen our community
