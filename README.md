Open source tools for fairness testing:

Fairness Measures: https://github.com/megantosh/fairness_measures_code
Framework to test given algorithm on variety of datasets and fairness metrics

Fairness Comparison: https://github.com/algofairness/fairness-comparison
Extensible test-bed to facilitate direct comparisons of algorithms with respect to fairness measures. Includes raw and preprocessed datasets

Themis-ML: https://github.com/cosmicBboy/themis-ml
Python library built on scikit-learn that implements fairness-aware machine learning algorithms

FairML: https://github.com/adebayoj/fairml
Looks at significance of the model inputs to quantify prediction dependence on inputs

Aequitas: https://github.com/dssg/aequitas
Web audit tool as well as Python library. Generates bias reports for given model and dataset

Fairtest: https://github.com/columbia/fairtest
Tests for associations between algorithm outputs and protected populations

Themis: https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/Themis
Takes a black-box decision-making procedure and designs test cases automatically to explore where the procedure might be exhibiting group-based or casual discrimination

Audit-AI: https://github.com/pymetrics/audit-ai
Python library built on top of scikit-learn with various statistics. Tests for classification and regression tasks
